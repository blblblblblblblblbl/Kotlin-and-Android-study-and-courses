      "content":"T\uFEFFhe Australian Open looks poised to be stripped of another blockbuster drawcard as officials try desperately to determine the playing status, and whereabouts, of two-time champion Naomi Osaka.\n\nThe Japanese ace\uFEFF remains on the official Australian Open entry list, but she hasn't played since Tokyo's Pan Pacific Open in September and isn't down to compete in Adelaide or Hobart next week.\n\nShe was tagged in a photo from a pilates studio in Los Angeles, but Tennis Australia officials are unable to confirm where she is.\n\nOsaka took a mental health break after skipping the Roland-Garros tournament of 2021, before revealing she'd been battling depression and anxiety for several years.\n\nShe pulled out during the second round of the Pan Pacific Open due to abdominal pain and has won only two of her last nine matches.\n\nOsaka conquered the Australian Open in 2019 and 2021, and the US Open in 2018 and 2020.\uFEFF\n\nThis year's Australian Open entry list is already missing reigning champion Ash Barty, seven-time winner Serena Williams and six-time winner Roger Federer, all of whom have retired in the last 12 months.\n\nAfter being deported on the cusp of last year's Australian Open, Novak Djokovic is back in the country and hunting a record-extending 10th title in Melbourne\uFEFF.\n\nBuoyed by reaching the 2022 Wimbledon final and the last eight at the US Open, Nick Kyrgios is gunning for his maiden grand slam title."

      "content":"ADELAIDE\nRory Sloane only played four games in 2022 due to a ruptured ACL in April but, despite that, he is still the captain and very much the Crows’ spiritual leader. His output started to wane a bit in 2021, and given he’s 33 in March, it’s hard to know just how much impact he will have this season, but one thing you can guarantee is that he will be leading by example, as he always does.\nYou don’t need to look further than the captain Chelsea Randall. A marquee signing for the Crows who has captained/co-captained the team to three premierships, Randall is also a four-time All-Australian and five-time winner of the players’ most courageous award. But it’s really about Randall’s setting of standards and the way she commands respect for her playing group and league, along with her willingness to put her body on the line for the team.\nBRISBANE LIONS\nYou can have your Lachie Neales, and your Daniel Richs, but there is only one Rhys Mathieson. The man they call “Beast Mode” has become somewhat of a cult figure among the Brisbane faithful. After consistently putting up massive numbers in the VFL last year, he finally broke into the senior team in round 17, and never looked back, playing the final 10 games, including all three finals. Now that Mitch Robinson has retired, the mantle of spiritual leader has officially been passed on to Mathieson.\nBrisbane are spoiled for choice. A big reason they remained relatively unscathed from the last expansion period was the loyalty across the board despite rival club interest. Sophie Conway, Shannon Campbell, Orla O’Dwyer and Ally Anderson all could reasonably take up this spot, but no one deserves it more than Breanna Koenen, who since taking over the captaincy last year after Emma Zielke retired plays with even more intensity than ever.\nCARLTON\nAFL: This was a coin flip between Sam Docherty and Patrick Cripps and despite Cripps staking his claim as the club’s best and most important player in 2022 after winning the Brownlow Medal, Docherty is too hard to ignore. The rebounding defender has fought back from two ACL ruptures and two bouts of cancer to not only survive at AFL level, but thrive. Defying all the odds, Docherty produced arguably his career-best season in 2022, and was extremely unlucky to miss out on the All-Australian squad. His teammates love him and he provides an endless amount of inspiration for them.\nAFLW: Darcy Vescio has been the main face of Carlton’s AFLW team since the start of the competition, guiding them through many ups and down. A marquee signing in 2016 and the first Bagger to reach 50 games, Vescio was at the club even before that, working in the club’s design team. Along with kicking snags onfield, they also have injected a lot of personality and heart into the club. And at 29, there’s still a lot of football ahead.\n\nCOLLINGWOOD\nAFL: The Magpies have no shortage of players to choose from in this department with Taylor Adams, Steele Sidebottom, Jack Crisp and Brayden Maynard all fitting the bill comfortably, but when you have a walking, talking bronze statue in your team still playing so well in the twilight of his career, it’s hard to go past him. That’s right, Scott Pendlebury continues to make a mockery of Father Time and has legitimate claims as Collingwood’s greatest player. Pendlebury turns 35 this week, but after claiming his 14th top-three finish in his club’s best-and-fairest last year, his legend only continues to grow.\n\nAFLW: Similar to the men’s group, there are plenty to choose from in the women’s side when it comes to the heart and soul of the Magpies, including captain Steph Chiocci, Chloe Molloy, Brianna Davey, Ruby Schleicher and Stacey Livingstone. But it’s hard to ignore Brittany Bonnici, who really is the glue of the team. Despite doing her ACL early last season and missing the majority of the past two seasons, the 25-year-old has been a pillar for the team, taking on an off-field leadership role while on the sidelines.\nESSENDON\nAFL: In a team that features Zach Merrett, Dyson Heppell and Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti, it’s saying something when you have been unofficially ordained the club’s spiritual leader. That’s exactly the situation exciting ruckman Sam Draper finds himself in. Less than three years after making his debut, Draper has quickly become a massive club favourite both within The Hangar and among fans. He had a breakout year in 2022 and on multiple occasions has grabbed his team and put them on his broad shoulders when the situation calls for it. He is already one of the AFL’s best celebrators, and he made no exception for his spectacular goal of the year against Gold Coast last year.\n\nAFLW: While Maddy Prespakis’ light looms large for the club, it’s really co-captain Bonnie Toogood who is the spiritual leader. A lifelong Essendon supporter and an inaugural co-captain, along with Steph Cain, Toogood embodies so much of what the Bombers are about. She took her game up a notch in season seven, earning her first All-Australian squad inclusion. She was named best club person in the club’s first year, along with the player values award and was runner-up for club best and fairest.\n\nFREMANTLE\nAFL: Even after the irreplaceable David Mundy retired, the Dockers still have a bunch of experienced veterans such as Nat Fyfe, Alex Pearce and Michael Walters, but a youngster by the name of Andrew Brayshaw has quickly become the face of the Fremantle Football Club. He exploded in his fifth year, winning the AFLPA MVP and his first Dockers best and fairest, while also earning a maiden All-Australian jumper. He finished just four votes shy of Patrick Cripps in the Brownlow, too. This is his midfield now, so much so that two-time Brownlow winner Fyfe said on multiple occasions last year that he was prepared to play wherever he was needed as he plotted his comeback from a long-term shoulder injury.\n\nAFLW: There are many dedicated purple hearts at Fremantle. Emma O’Driscoll, Ange Stannett, Ebony Antonio, captain Hayley Miller, and you just have to go to a home game to see 21-year-old Roxy Roux is a fan favourite. Yet Kiara Bowers stands above them all. A marquee signing who’s gone from strength to strength over the years – including taking out the league best and fairest with Brianna Davey in 2021 – Bowers takes the team into a new gear when she’s on the field. She’s also been club best and fairest four times.\nGEELONG\nAFL: If you thought Geelong would be left wanting in this area following the retirement of inspirational skipper Joel Selwood, you’d be sadly mistaken. In fact, the Cats are awash with heart-and-soul types: Tom Hawkins, Patrick Dangerfield, Tom Stewart, Mark Blicavs, Mitch Duncan, Cam Guthrie, Zach Tuohy – they are quite literally spoiled for choice. But one man who really stands out from the crowd is Tom Atkins. His story is one of grit, perseverance and determination. He had to do it the hard way and after years toiling away in the Cats’ VFL team, finally got a chance in the 2019 rookie draft as a 24-year-old. He had to reinvent himself again last year as a hard-at-it inside midfielder, and rose to the challenge again to become one of the most important players in one of the most dominant teams of the modern era and earn himself a premiership.\n\nAFLW: While a case could be made for both Meg McDonald and Amy McDonald – and for Georgie Prespakis in years to come – Nina Morrison just nudges her way to this title. The No. 1 draft pick from 2018 earned a rising star nomination in her debut before an ACL setback.\nGOLD COAST\nAFL: Matt Rowell and Noah Anderson might be vying for this mantle in the years to come, but right now, there is only one man who is the Suns’ spiritual leader – Touk Miller. Outside of Gary Ablett, Miller is probably the greatest player in Gold Coast’s short history. He sets the standards, he leads by example and is a magnificent player. During an interview with Fox Footy last year, Anderson joked that he wasn’t sure if he was going to make it in the AFL as he struggled to keep up with Miller in intense training sessions during his first pre-season. It is an anecdote that perfectly sums up the dual All-Australian’s work ethic, which has doubtlessly played a key role in slowly but surely turning the Suns into a competitive outfit at long last.\n\nAFLW: A lot of Kalinda Howarth’s journey is emblematic of Gold Coast’s in the league, and that, plus her unyielding love for the club, is why she’s the spiritual leader of the group. Long before she was drafted, Howarth was a lifelong supporter of the club, and playing for the Suns has been a dream of hers since 2013. She was originally signed by Brisbane in 2017 but was delisted the following year. Taken as a priority signing for the Suns in 2019, she’s lifted her game immensely and is now the kind of player relied upon by others. She’s worked hard to get where she is, similar to the Suns’ journey, who despite not yet enjoying a finals campaign, have seen tremendous improvement in the last year.\nGREATER WESTERN SYDNEY\nAFL: The description “colourful character” puts it mildly, but it’s hard to think of a club in the AFL that draws so heavily on one player as GWS does on Toby Greene. A flawed genius, not only is Greene one of the premier small forwards in the competition, but the co-captain is the beating heart of the Giants. Callan Ward and Phil Davis did a great job of nurturing and cultivating the expansion club’s culture over its first decade, but this is well and truly Greene’s team.\n\nAFLW: GWS aren’t starved in this area with four-time club best and fairest Alyce Parker, Irish stalwart Cora Staunton and captain and All-Australian Alicia Eva on the books. And it’s the latter who really defines the spirit of the first Sydney team in the league as Eva has personified the club since joining it in 2018. She led the side through the devastating death of teammate Jacinda Barclay and the COVID years, and has an unyielding belief on show each time she takes the field. As foundation player Rebecca Beeson once described her, she’s a captain with all care.\n\nHAWTHORN\nAFL: The Hawks have undergone a similar transition to the Giants with star defender James Sicily assuming the role of spiritual leader. He hasn’t been named the club’s new skipper yet, but you get the sense that it’s a fait accompli. And after a string of short-term captaincies under Jarryd Roughead, Ben Stratton and Ben McEvoy, the Hawks look set for a long era under Sicily, who only turned 28 on Friday. The stage is set for Sicily to mould this team in his own image as the ultra-competitive player that he is.\n\nAFLW: With Hawthorn having only been in the competition for one season, it’s hard to pick a spiritual leader so soon. There’s plenty of youngsters on their list who could take up this claim in future years, including Jasmine Fleming, Tahlia Fellows and Sophie Locke, but right now, none embody it more than Irish import Aileen Gilroy. It’s rare for an Irish player to change colours, but once Gilroy switched from the Roos to the Hawks, she seemed to just bleed brown and gold. Shown best in her winning the club’s gold standards award, as voted by her peers.\n\nMELBOURNE\nAFL: In a team blessed with the likes of Clayton Oliver, Christian Petracca, Jack Viney and Angus Brayshaw, one man stands above all – the inimitable Max Gawn. Gawn is the embodiment and physical representation of the Demons’ stunning turnaround in fortunes in recent years, which culminated with them breaking one of the VFL/AFL’s most famous premiership droughts. The bearded giant has captained his club with aplomb and not only leads the way off the field, but does a sensational job of doing so on it as well and is arguably the Demons’ most important player.\nAFLW: There’s a lot of players who could easily be touted as heart and soul when it comes to the Demons. Karen Paxman, Libby Birch, Lily Mithen, Kate Hore and more recently Tayla Harris could all take the cake, but it really could only be one: Daisy Pearce. The first Melbourne AFLW player on the list, inaugural captain and now premiership player. Pearce is a three-time club best and fairest, three-time All-Australian and four-time AFLW best captain. And they are known as “Daisy’s Dees” after all.\n\nNORTH MELBOURNE\nAFL: If you needed a reminder of what Ben Cunnington means to the Kangaroos, just have a look back to his comeback game against Adelaide in round 22 last year. The outpouring of emotion for the star midfielder following his recovery from cancer was palpable. Not only is he still one of North’s best players when he’s fully fit, he is also a role model for so many of the club’s younger players who look up to him in awe. Cunnington in many ways has been the glue that has held Arden Street together during what has been an extremely tough three years.\n\nAFLW: This one’s a toss up between skipper and stalwart Emma Kearney and superstar Roo Jasmine Garner, who despite each year being touted as a league best-and-fairest favourite, gets overlooked in the counts. On-field, teammates and fans can just breathe a little easier with the three-time club champion in the engine room, and off-field she’s been integral to building the team culture. Although, to be honest, her younger brother Kane, who you can hear loudly at every North Melbourne game, needs some credit for being the spiritual leader of the outer.\n\nPORT ADELAIDE\nAFL: Look no further than Travis Boak. While he wasn’t as devastating last year as in his stellar 2020 and 2021 campaigns, the AFL club’s games record-holder is going strong at the age of 34. Ollie Wines and Tom Jonas are certainly providing their fair share of leadership for the Power, but as one of their greatest players, Boak still commands respect from his peers and is synonymous with the Port Adelaide name.\nAFLW: It’s incredibly rare for a spiritual leader of a club to have once been the co-captain of its main rival, but then again, there really hasn’t been a story quite like Erin Phillips’ before. A three-time premiership player and two-time league best and fairest, the 37-year-old came home to the club she grew up around as her father played 343 for the Power. The first captain of Port Adelaide’s women’s side, Phillips embodies so much of the club’s history and future.\n\nRICHMOND\nAFL: Another club with many candidates to choose from. Dustin Martin, Trent Cotchin, Dylan Grimes, Nick Vlastuin, Jack Riewoldt, Liam Baker and Dion Prestia all fit the bill nicely, but ruckman Toby Nankervis truly epitomises what the Tigers are all about. He took to the co-captaincy like a duck to water in his first season in the job last year, producing arguably the best season of his triple -premiership career as he led from the front brilliantly. Richmond walk that little bit taller when Nankervis runs out with them.\n\nAFLW: Courtney Wakefield would have been a shoo-in for this had she not retired at the end of last season but, even then, it would have been hard to ignore what Katie Brennan has done for the club. Joining in 2020 as an inaugural player and captain, she led by example through the rocky first years before leading the side to its maiden finals in season seven. Despite having stars on the list, there’s a notable difference in the ferocity of the group when she’s on the field.\n\nST KILDA\nAFL: The rapid transformation of Jack Steele into not only one of the AFL’s elite midfielders, but the Saints’ spiritual leader has been one of the more noteworthy storylines of the past couple of years. Steele sets the standards and lives up to those standards every time he sets foot on a footy ground. With two All-Australians and two best-and-fairests in his back pocket, he commands respect in everything that he does.\n\nAFLW: Sharpshooter Kate Shierlaw and captain Hannah Priest are perhaps the more notable faces of the team but it’s Bianca Jakobsson who embodies so much of the Saints’ fighting spirit. The 29-year-old took a break from the game in 2020 and wasn’t sure if she would return, but then slotted straight into the team in 2021. She plays her heart out for the team each week, which earned her the club’s best and fairest last season. And you’d be hard-pressed to find a game in the last year where she wasn’t one of the best.\nSYDNEY\nAFL: Is there a more underrated AFL player over the past decade than Luke Parker? It’s hard to think of one. Perhaps if he played the majority of his career in Victoria, he would receive the appropriate plaudits. You only have to listen to the way coach John Longmire speaks about Parker to get an understanding of what he means to the Swans. An invaluable member of the squad who consistently leads by example with his actions.\n\nAFLW: It’s hard to pick a spiritual leader in such a new and young team but Cynthia Hamilton, at just 18, has already shown she’s up for the task. Already a fan favourite who embodies the Bloods’ culture, she’s been a bright spark for a team that’s yet to score a win. She’s also the club champion and shown she’s got leadership potential. In that regard, she’s got company alongside fellow teenager Sofia Hurley.\n\nWEST COAST\nAFL: The end is drawing near for Shannon Hurn, but the 35-year-old still has a bit left to give before his outstanding 18-year career comes to an end. The club’s first 300-game player and games record-holder, Hurn has been a cool and calm head in defence for years, and the former captain’s vast experience will once again be called upon in what looms as another tough year for the Eagles.\n\nAFLW: This just has to be Emma Swanson. Swanson has always been an integral part of the Eagles’ midfield group but took it up a notch last year, capping it off by claiming the club champion and player trademark award. She’s a point of inspiration and energy for the group, which is yet to taste any real success in the league.\n\nWESTERN BULLDOGS\nAFL: He’s only 27 years old, but the truth of the matter is Marcus Bontempelli has been the heart and soul of the Western Bulldogs for years. In fact, it’s been the case since his second or third year at the club. An extremely rare and special talent who helped transform the Dogs into a premiership power again after almost six decades in the wilderness, he is one of the best captains in the league, and will go down as a Bulldogs great by the time his brilliant career ends.\nAFLW: You really can’t go past Ellie Blackburn for this one, although Kirsty Lamb is right up there with fan-favourite status. No one steps up more when the side needs them, nor plays with their heart on their sleeve, quite like the Bulldogs skipper. This was best put on show when she kicked a last-minute goal in round 10 last season to get the side into the finals. And her football is just continually on an upward trajectory, as she claimed her third club best and fairest last year.\n"

      "content":"Australia have two days left of their home Test season to push for the victory that would give them a clean sweep of the summer and, barring extreme points deductions, secure a place in the World Test Championship final at The Oval in June.\n\nHowever, regardless of having their spot booked before heading to India that tour will be one of the series that defines their year and against their likely opponents in the WTC final, albeit in vastly different conditions. It will, therefore, be intriguing to see which players fill the fringe places in the squad that will be announced shortly after the Sydney Test is finished.\n\nSome of the names called up for the final match against South Africa have given a clear indication of the way the selectors will go. Ashton Agar can be locked in with Matt Renshaw highly likely to be included given the versatility he provides while Peter Handscomb, added late to the Sydney squad, is another expected to travel as a spare batter. Marcus Harris, having travelled all summer as a reserve, may end up unlucky again.\nAlongside those who are certain selections it does not leave many gaps to fill, although the injury concerns with Mitchell Starc and Cameron Green may mean a slightly larger group travels. Green has conceded they are both in a race against time for the opening Test in Nagpur.\nThere will be at least one more frontline spinner alongside Agar and Nathan Lyon, and there could yet be two. Legspinner Mitchell Swepson, who played in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, will be in the frame as will the uncapped offspinner Todd Murphy who is very highly regarded. The chances of a surprise call-up for Adam Zampa appear to have receded.\n\n\"Todd's putting his hand up with the performances he's put on the board,\" coach Andrew McDonald said after the MCG Test. \"Mitch Swepson performed well in the subcontinent previously.\n\n\"Matt Renshaw coming in again in Test cricket has had some success there before. Pete Handscomb, no doubt, would probably consider himself unlucky not to be in that conversation for Sydney, but there's another one coming back into the Test fold in conversation. We've got Marcus Harris also. So feel we've got Test experience within that depth.\"\n\nWhile Australia may only play two frontline quicks during some of the series, supplemented by Green when he is fit, they will likely have plenty of options at their disposal. Scott Boland's wicket-to-wicket skills, and ability to find reverse swing, could yet be valuable if pitches are uneven while the uncapped Lance Morris would provide a 150-kph point of difference.\n\nAs has been made clear in Sydney, there is no like-for-like cover for Green given Mitchell Marsh is sidelined after an ankle surgery and fellow Western Australia allrounder Aaron Hardie is understood to be considered not quite ready for the elevation."

      "content":"A European Super League 'will be a reality' in the next two years, claims Barcelona president Joan Laporta, despite organisers failing with its previous attempt.\n\nThe original plans for a bold breakaway Super League were foiled within 48 hours last year following a furious backlash from fans in England, with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Man City and Man United soon performing a u-turn as owners later coughed up apologies for getting involved in the first place.\n\nReal Madrid, Juventus and Barcelona have continued to push for a breakaway competition and Laporta has now claimed it will 'be a reality' in two years and can compete with the Premier League.\n\n'I think there will be a Super League,' he told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser. 'In March we will have the ruling of the EU Court of Justice.\n'I would not have entered into this project if it was not an open competition and it was accepted by Real Madrid, Juventus and other clubs that have not yet shown their faces but are very interested in this competition.\n\n'What we want is for the clubs to govern. That is why the Luxembourg Court ruling is so important. I hope that UEFA will be part of the governance table.'\n\nLast month the Super League Company launched legal action against UEFA, claiming it had breached EU law, but the European Court of Justice backed UEFA's position.\nAdvocate General Athanasios Rantos said that while Super League organisers were entitled to set up an independent competition 'outside the UEFA and FIFA ecosystem, it cannot however, in parallel with the creation of such a competition, continue to participate in the football competitions organised by FIFA and UEFA without the prior authorisation of those federations.' \n\nAdvocates general routinely provide legal guidance to the ECJ. Their opinions aren't binding on the Luxembourg-based court but are followed in most cases.\n\nA final ruling, which is not expected until March, could bring the hammer down on Laporta and other executives' aspirations but he remains convinced that a breakaway competition can be pushed through. \n\n'It will be a reality in 2025, if the resolution is favourable,' he continued. \n\n'If the ruling, which I believe will not happen because what is being called into question is the defence of free competition in the framework of the EU, and I believe that this will be won.\n\n'In a first step, what we will have is a European competition that will compete with the Premiership.\n\n'I don't think the English teams are going to enter in the first step.'\nBernd Reichert, CEO of A22 Sports, the new company that is working to deliver a Super League, insisted last month that the Super League 'is not dead' and it is 'very much alive'. \n\nFollowing the publication of the legal judgement last month, UEFA said in a statement: 'UEFA welcomes today's unequivocal Opinion of Advocate General Rantos, which is an encouraging step towards preserving the existing dynamic and democratic governance structure of the European football pyramid. \n\n'The Opinion reinforces the central role of federations in protecting the sport, upholding fundamental principles of sporting merit and open access across our members, as well as uniting football with shared responsibility and solidarity.\n\n'Football in Europe remains united and steadfastly opposed to the ESL, or any such breakaway proposals, which would threaten the entire European sports ecosystem.\n\n'While we await the Court's final judgement due next year, UEFA, as a public interest, not-for-profit governing body, will continue to be fully focused on its mission to develop football for all, in close cooperation with national associations, leagues, clubs, players, fans, EU institutions, governments and other relevant stakeholders who have the true values of football at heart.'\nMeanwhile, FIFA added in a statement of their own: 'FIFA welcomes the Opinion issued today by Advocate General Rantos of the European Court of Justice in which he confirms the standing and legitimacy of FIFA and UEFA to approve any new football competitions. By the same token, the Advocate General considers that sanctions may be imposed in respect of competitions which do not satisfy the approved authorisation criteria.\n\n'FIFA also welcomes the Advocate General's recognition of FIFA's exclusive rights to market international competitions organised by FIFA.\n\n'Finally, FIFA welcomes the recognition by the Advocate General of the special nature of sport, including the pyramid structure, which preserves the nature of sporting merit and open competitions accessible to all, as well as the principles of promotion and relegation, competitive balance, and financial solidarity.'"

      "content":"Сhelsea manager Graham Potter showed the strength of his personality against Manchester City by taking off Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, himself a substitute, for an 18-year old-debutant.\n\nThe 33-year-old striker has struggled for minutes under Potter in recent weeks but got his chance after Raheem Sterling was injured in the first couple of minutes of the match.\n\nAn anonymous outing saw him touch the ball just once in the opposition’s box and 14 times overall.\n\nPotter has been gentle, mild-mannered and relaxed in the face of poor performances and bad body language but he cracked here, taking off the Gabon international to give Omari Hutchinson his debut.\n\nAubameyang was furious coming off the pitch, shaking his head in dismay as the substitute was substituted.\nThere was no hiding place and his manager exposed his performance, opting to prioritise the team’s needs to bring on a deserving youngster.\n\nHutchinson was not only making his Chelsea debut, as he bid to help his former club Arsenal in the title race, but also his professional debut.\n\nHe needed a lot of coaching during the match by Potter and his assistant Bjorn Hamberg, but still looked more threatening than his senior teammate.\n\nIt wasn’t only Aubameyang that was taken off, with Marc Cucurella, who was one of those at fault for the goal, brought off for teenager Lewis Hall.\n\nNeither change influenced the result but it was a signal of future standards of what is acceptable and what is not.\nRiyad Mahrez’s far post tap-in secured all three points after he latched onto Jack Grealish’s excellent cross. It leaves Chelsea ten points off the top four, 19 behind league leaders Arsenal and in tenth in the Premier League.\n\nYet, there was something to build on in the performance with Potter’s side responding well to his tactics and decisions for the first time in months.\n\nThey were unlucky to lose and the players and supporters reacted well to Potter, who showed his most charismatic and aggressive side yet.\n\nIt may take more of that spirit to get Chelsea through an injury crisis and a dismal run of results, and for him to prove his critics wrong."

      "content":"Low scores were abound in the first round of the Sentry Tournament of Champions in Hawaii, with Jon Rahm, Collin Morikawa and JJ Spaun all sharing the lead on nine-under par.\n\nEach of the trio carded 64 to commence their PGA Tour seasons in fine fashion.\n\nThey lead by one from South Korea's Tom Kim, who picked up two eagles en route to an opening round 65.\nEngland's Matt Fitzpatrick is among six players who are two strokes back on seven under, while Ireland's Seamus Power is two shots further back after carding a round of 68.\n\nDespite the leaders' low scores, only three shots separate the top 16 players headed into the second round.\nThe Tournament of Champions, which includes 39 players, is the first of 17 designated PGA Tour events with elevated purses this year. In the past, this event was limited to players who won a tournament the previous year, but the 2023 field was expanded to feature players who did not win in 2022 but did reach the Tour Championship.\n\nMorikawa was just two under par at the turn before reeling off six consecutive birdies. Following two pars, he closed with another birdie at the par-five 18th hole.\n\nHe credited the strong round to start the year in part to work with two new members of his team, putting coach Stephen Sweeney and chipping coach Parker McLachlin.\n\n\"It's good to have someone that knows a lot about short game and you just kind of bounce ideas off,\" Morikawa said of McLachlin.\n\nAs for his work with Sweeney, Morikawa said, \"I just have answers. Before when I was putting, it was like guess work. I might have putted well today and then thought I was doing something, but in reality it was something else.\"\nSpaun's round was highlighted by a string of four straight birdies in the middle of the back nine.\n\nHe said of his initial round after the circuit's holiday break:\n\n\"The walk is kind of tough. My toes hurt, but it was a great first round for me out here on Tour and in competition. So, yeah, I can't ask for anything more.\"\nAsked if he ever experienced toe problems previously, he said, \"I think this is a first for me. Just all those uphills and then downhill, you're really on the balls of your feet all day.\n\"Walking downhill is almost just as hard. It's like, you're kind of like bracing yourself, so it's hard. Tough life out here (smiling).\"\n\nDefending champion Cameron Smith of Australia is not in the field after jumping from the PGA Tour to LIV Golf."

      "content":"Daniel Ricciardo has revealed a private chat with Michael Schumacher in his second season in F1 was one of his formative memories as an F1 driver.\n\nSchumacher is one of the greatest drivers in F1 history, sitting side-by-side with Lewis Hamilton on a record seven world championships.\n\nWatch Every Practice, Qualifying & Race of the 2023 FIA Formula One World Championship™ Live on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >\n\nBut since his skiing accident, the German motorsport legend has taken on an almost mythical quality in the sport, even more so than when he was racing.\n\nSchumacher was a fierce competitor, even famously playing mind games with teammates, including locking former world champion Nico Rosberg out of a toilet minutes before qualifying.\n\nRicciardo has a good memory with Schumacher however, revealing some private words of encouragement that helped him settle into his Formula One career.\n\nSpeaking recently to Speedcafe, Ricciardo revealed a 10th placed finish at Suzuka in 2012 was one of the favourite drives of his career.\nAt the time, it was his fourth points finish in F1 but it was how it happened that was meaningful for Ricciardo, holding off Schumacher for the last 17 laps to hang onto a points finish.\n\n“I defended Schumacher in the last part of the race, and I won the last point in 10th,” Ricciardo said.\n\n“That was just more like … yes, I was still intimidated by him at that time; obviously I was like, he’s God.\n\n“When he caught me, if there was live betting, I wouldn’t have bet on myself that I was going to keep him behind for the next 10 laps of whatever.\n\n“The fact that I did that, and the level of comfort I felt defending him, I kind of surprised myself with my race craft.”\n\nIn 2012, Schumacher was in the final year of his career driving for Mercedes. He claimed only one more podium and finished 13th in the championship.\n\nIn contrast, it was Ricciardo’s first of two seasons at Toro Rosso (now known as AlphaTauri) before he was promoted to the top team at Red Bull and just his second in F1.\nBut while Schumacher was at the end of his incredible career, some words of respect for the young Aussie from the seven-time champion changed his F1 trajectory.\n\n“From that, I grew a lot of confidence,” Ricciardo continued.\n\n“That was a very important race for me which is not talked about because I finished 10th.\n\n“But personally, for me, it was really big.\n\n“It was followed up by him congratulating me (at) the following race on the drivers’ parade, I remember he came up and said ‘good job last week defending’.\n\n“That, for me, getting a bit of confirmation from someone like that, at that age, and that point in my career was huge.\n\n“Maybe he didn’t realise at the time what he was doing, but he boosted my confidence a lot.”\n\nFrom there, Ricciardo had two third-place championship finishes in five seasons at Red Bull and claimed seven race wins and 30 podiums as he built a reputation for his late braking and excellent defence.\n\nHowever, his move to Renault and then McLaren in the past few seasons only added one win and two podiums to his career tally and has left his career at a crossroads.\n\nNext season he is set to be the reserve driver for Red Bull, following his worst season in F1 since 2013.\n\nWhile the door isn’t completely closed for Ricciardo, he was accused of having “cashed in” in his exit from Red Bull in 2018.\nMcLaren boss Zak Brown didn’t close the door on Ricciardo either, having said on McLaren's YouTube: “If the stars align, I’d love to go racing with him again.”\n\nBut he also admitted Ricciardo’s lack of success in papaya will continue to be a “great mystery”.\n\n“We don’t know,” Brown responded when asked by Speedcafe why Ricciardo had not worked out. “We’ve certainly analysed it. We gave it everything we’ve got, Daniel gave it everything he’s got and our relationship with Daniel was great.\n\n“It was clearly disappointing for both of us as to the outcome but I think it’s a bit of a great mystery as to why [it happened]. I don’t think Daniel knows, we don’t know, we tried everything. Maybe we worked too hard.\n\n“I think ultimately that’s why we both decided to make a change because we had tried everything and we really didn’t know why it wasn’t clicking.\n\n“So hopefully a change of environment for him [will mean] he’ll get his magic back because for sure he’s a magical guy. You saw in Monza what he’s capable of, and he’s done that seven other times. But we needed to make a change because we couldn’t figure out what had gone wrong.”"

      "content":"Although India had the slimmest of chances of winning the match from that situation, the fans were not happy to see the Indian captain Hardik Pandya starting post-match handshakes with the last ball of the match still remaining.\nHardik Pandya bore a sorry look for the most part of the 2nd T20I against Sri Lanka. He had fair reasons for it. His gun T20I bowler Arshdeep Singh created an unwanted world record for bowling the most front foot no-balls in a T20I. He overstepped as many as five times in his two overs at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. India gave away 7 free hits on Thursday and bowled four more wides, allowing Sri Lanka to post 206 for six batting first. There was no end to Hardik's and India's woes as they lost four wickets for just 34 - Hardik himself was out for 12 - in just 4.4 overs. Deepak Hooda too fell for not too many as India were tottering at 57 for 5, still needing 150 runs off just 65 balls at almost 15 runs per over. Most sides would lose the match by a huge margin from this situation. But not India. In fact, they made such a strong comeback that the chase was alive till the last over.\nIt was all thanks to a stunning partnership between Axar Patel and Suryakumar Yadav. Axar, who appeared to be batting on a different surface against a different bowling attack than the rest of the Indian batters, started to play shots from the word go. He was so good that he outscored Suryakumar by some distance in the partnership.\nThe asking rate, however, was still daunting and Sri Lanka were firmly in the driver's seat till the 13th over. Things would take a drastic turn in the next over. Axar hit a hat-trick of sixes off Wanindu Hasaranga and his partner Suryakumar hit one as India took 26 runs off the over to set the cat among the pigeons. The crowd and the Indian dressing room got their voices back. The atmosphere stayed the same for the next two overs with both Axar and SKY going hammer and tongs.\nThings appeared gloomy again when Suryakumar was out for 51 towards the end of the 16th over. Just when the balance shifted heavily towards easy Sri Lanka once again, young Shivam Mavi hit a couple of sixes and a four off the last three balls of the 18th over to make India believe again.\n\nSri Lanka, however, held their nerves in the final two overs to close out the match but just before the match was officially over - India needed 1 run off 17 balls, practically impossible without a miracle or two - captain Hardik Pandya was seen shaking hands with the Indian players and support staff. Normally players shake hands with teammates and the opponents after the match is over.\nPhotos of Hardik walking up to Jitesh Sharma, the fielding coach T Dilip, and Shubman Gill and shaking their hands one by one with the match still going on went viral.\n\nAlthough India had the slimmest of chances of winning the match from that situation, the fans were not happy to see the Indian captain starting post-match handshakes with the last ball of the match still remaining."

      "content":"An unforeseen hurdle has emerged in the Wallabies’ preparations ahead of this year’s Rugby World Cup with assistant coach Scott Wisemantel leaving his role with the team.\n\nJust eight months out from the sport’s major tournament, the Wallabies attacking coach has resigned his role with immediate effect in order to focus on interests outside of rugby, both in his personal life and business endeavours.\n\nThe 52-year-old joined the Wallabies ahead of the 2020 international season for his second stint with the national team, having first been with the side in 2004.\n\nWisemantel was no stranger to coaching on the World Cup stage, working as an assistant coach for Australia, Samoa, Japan and England across the last four tournaments, and his experience will be a big loss for the side.\n\n“While this has been a very difficult decision, it’s one that’s best for me and my family at this point in time,” Wisemantel said of the decision.\n\n“The World Cup is the pinnacle of our sport and requires 100 per cent commitment and that’s something I’m unfortunately unable to give at the moment.\n\n“I’ve loved being with this team under Dave (Rennie) and wish them all the best for their season and in the World Cup later this year.”\n\nHead coach Rennie said the Wallabies worked to retain Wisemantel’s services, but were ultimately unable to persuade him to remain on.\n\n“He’s hugely respected around the world, has a mountain of experience at International level and an incredible rapport with our players.\n\n“While we did all we could to try and keep Scott, we respect his decision and wish him, Gabs and the girls all the best.\n\n“He’s been a massive part of this group for the past three years and we’ll miss him.”\n\nWisemantel is the second coach to leave the side in the last six months, after defence coach Matt Taylor stepped away in August.\n\nThe Wallabies have begun the process in their search for a replacement, with a training squad set to enter a four-day camp on the Gold Coast next week."
