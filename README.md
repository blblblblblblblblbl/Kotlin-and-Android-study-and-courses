# Kotlin/Android study/courses

This is old repo with my projects, when I began to study android development. Then I got free courses by government program from Skillbox. Projects from coursers was on gitlab, then were moved to this repo. Also there is my one pet-project.
It was a mistake to store all projects in one repo, so I created separate repos for courser and pet-project.
